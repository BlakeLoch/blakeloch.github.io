## 🧭 About

I'm a game developer and systems generalist currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science (Games) at USC. I build gameplay systems, tools, and pipelines—often combining technical direction with production and creative design.

I also work in creative tech and music as the CTO of Birdbath Entertainment.
